    "This process for the single kernel matrix element could be repeated between other data pairs in your set to obtain the full kernel matrix. The dimension of the kernel matrix is dictated by the number of points in your training data, not the number of features. So the computing cost of manipulating the kernel matrix into a predictive model does not scale like the number of features or qubits. Even for relatively small datasets with large numbers of features, the data would still need to be matched to a feature map that yields effective classification.\n",

    "The kernel method requires that we measure the $|0\\rangle$ as accurately as possible. But gate errors and readout errors mean that there is some non-zero probability $p$ that any given qubit will be erroneously measured to be in the $|1\\rangle$ state. Even with the oversimplification that the probability of $|0\\rangle$ should be $100\\%$, for many features encoded on, say, $N$ bits, the probability of correctly measuring all bits to be $|0\\rangle$ is reduced to $(1-p)^N$. As $N$ becomes large, this method becomes less and less reliable. Overcoming this difficulty and scaling kernel estimation to more and more features is an area of current research. To learn more about this issue, see this work by [Thanasilp, Wang, Cerezo, and Holmes.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49287-w) We recommend you explore what can be done with current quantum computers, and also look forward to what will be possible in the era of error correction.\n",
