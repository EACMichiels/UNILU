    "Although you don't need to understand all the steps above, we should try to understand the output, so we know why we are doing this. Many processes in machine learning use inner products as part of binary classification (among other things). Quantum mechanics has an obvious connection with this, since the probabilities of measuring various states $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ are given by the inner product with an initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ through the inner product: $P_i = |\\langle\\phi_i|\\psi\\rangle|^2$. So what we have done above is created a quantum circuit that contains the features of our two data points, and maps them into the space of a quantum vector, then estimates the inner product in that space via making measurements. This is an example of quantum kernel estimation. Note we only implemented this process for two of the data points (the 14th and 19th). If we did this for all possible pairs, we could take the output (in this case the number 0.821...) and populate a matrix of results describing the overlap between all points in the training data set. This is the \"**kernel matrix**\".\n",
